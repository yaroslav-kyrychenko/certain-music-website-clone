# Spotify website main page clone

The goal of this project was try and recreate the general looks of the Spotify start page. This is a purely educational project aimed at practicing my HTML and CSS skills (i.e. if by any chance at any point in time someone from Spotify actually sees this, PLEASE DON'T SUE ME).

By "general looks" above I mean all the styling, layouts, animations, images, colors, shades, transitions etc. The only exception here is the font - I used Helvetica as it is actually recommended by Spotify as the closest to their custom font. I did try to make it look as similar as possible to the current version (as of December 19, 2024), however, Spotify changed layouts and styling multiple times during the whole period of me doing this project so I suspect I might have overlooked some things and something might look a little bit different.

There is no backend technology and honestly, the front end itself is quite limited, too. Only basic javascript is included, mostly for generating content automatically and a couple of functions for creating pretty graphic effects. The project itself took me nearly half a year and what started as a simple "how about I try to do this for a month just for the fun of it" turned out to be a challenging undertaking.
